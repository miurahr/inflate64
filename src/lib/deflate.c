/*
 *  ALGORITHM
 *
 *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
 *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Thanks to many people for bug reports and testing.

     *
     * Analysis: The longest fixed codes are a length code of 8 bits plus 5
     * extra bits, for lengths 131 to 257. The longest fixed distance codes are
     * 5 bits plus 13 extra bits, for distances 16385 to 32768. The longest
     * possible fixed-codes length/distance pair is then 31 bits total.
     *
     * sym_buf starts one-fourth of the way into pending_buf. So there are
     * three bytes in sym_buf for every four bytes in pending_buf. Each symbol
     * in sym_buf is three bytes -- two for the distance and one for the
     * literal/length. As each symbol is consumed, the pointer to the next
     * sym_buf value to read moves forward three bytes. From that symbol, up to
     * 31 bits are written to pending_buf. The closest the written pending_buf
     * bits gets to the next sym_buf symbol to read is just before the last
     * code is written. At that time, 31*(n-2) bits have been written, just
     * after 24*(n-2) bits have been consumed from sym_buf. sym_buf starts at
     * 8*n bits into pending_buf. (Note that the symbol buffer fills when n-1
     * symbols are written.) The closest the writing gets to what is unread is
     * then n+14 bits. Here n is lit_bufsize, which is 16384 by default, and
     * can range from 128 to 32768.
     *
     * Therefore, at a minimum, there are 142 bits of space between what is
     * written and what is read in the overlain buffers, so the symbols cannot
     * be overwritten by the compressed data. That space is actually 139 bits,
     * due to the three-bit fixed-code block header.
     *
     * That covers the case where either Z_FIXED is specified, forcing fixed
     * codes, or when the use of fixed codes is chosen, because that choice
     * results in a smaller compressed block than dynamic codes. That latter
     * condition then assures that the above analysis also covers all dynamic
     * blocks. A dynamic-code block will only be chosen to be emitted if it has
     * fewer bits than a fixed-code block would for the same set of symbols.
     * Therefore its average symbol length is assured to be less than 31. So
     * the compressed data for a dynamic block also cannot overwrite the
     * symbols from which it is being constructed.
